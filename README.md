Project Purpose – Learning OOP Through a Practical Library Management System

This project was created with the goal of deeply understanding Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by building a complete small-scale application from scratch.
Instead of learning concepts only in theory, I wanted to apply them inside a real, working Windows Forms application that handles books, reservations, stock information, and XML data persistence.

The main focus of the project was to learn:
  - how to design classes and relationships in OOP
  - how to connect backend logic with UI components
  - how to manage data flow between forms
  - and how to store and restore objects using XML serialization

🚀 What I accomplished in this project

  - Implemented the core architecture and applied OOP principles to my own model

  - Integrated UserControls and managed UI–backend communication

  - Understood and used Base64 + MemoryStream to handle image serialization

  - Built listing, looping, and double-click editing logic with ListView

  - Connected data models to UI elements using properties and controlled data binding

  - Correctly used getters/setters to manage data flow within the application

  - Managed communication between forms and the central DataBase class

  - Fixed and improved the static ID generation mechanism

  - Solved multiple runtime and logical errors during development

  - Implemented object passing between forms and created a working update/editing flow
